# Bun (Elysia) & HTMX & MVC

## About
On the wave of hype, I made a demo project consisting of bun & htmx. Made based on the MVC pattern (Laravel-inspired structure). New View Transitions API added as a bonus

## Development
To start the development server run:
```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000/ with your browser to see the result.
