# Bun (Elysia) & HTMX & MVC

## About
On the wave of hype, I made a demo project consisting of bun & htmx. Made based on the MVC pattern (Laravel-inspired structure). New View Transitions API added as a bonus

## Getting Started
To get started with this template, simply paste this command into your terminal:
```bash
bun create elysia ./elysia-example
```

## Development
To start the development server run:
```bash
bun run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000/ with your browser to see the result.
